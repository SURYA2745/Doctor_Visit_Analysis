# Doctor_Visit_Analysis
In this mini project, we explore the power of data science in analyzing doctor visits using python. We start by collecting data on patient visits such as age, gender, symptoms, and diagnosis. Then, we use python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to clean, preprocessing, and visualize the data.
