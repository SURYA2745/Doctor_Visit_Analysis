# Doctor_Visit_Analysis
In this Mini project, we Explore the power of Data science in Analyzing Doctor visits using python. We Start by Collecting data on patient visits such as Age, Gender, Symptoms, and Diagnosis. Then, We use Python Libraries such as pandas, Numpy and matplotlib to clean, preprocessing, and visualize the data.Finally, we apply Machine learning algorithms such Linear and Logistic regression to predict patient outcomes and identify potential risk factors.


By Conducting this Mini Project, we gain valuable insights into the Healthcare Industry and how data science can be used to Improve patient care and outcomes. With the Increasing amount of healthcare data being Generated every day, it is important for healthcare professionals to embrace data science and leverage its power to Drive innovation and Progress.
